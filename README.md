LCOM Project for group T14-G02.

## Write Wise 

Write Wise is a type racing game where you can test your typing abilities against someone else in a race.
It's based on a Operating System called Minix with very limited graphics.
The race mechanic works by means of a Serial Port.
The source code for the project is on directory [`proj`](./proj).

[Write Wise Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjn5M18D6io)

This demonstration works by instanciating 2 instances of the minix OS on 2 virtual machines.
The serial port is emulated by VirtualBox.
